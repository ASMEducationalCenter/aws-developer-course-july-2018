## On the previous class
- we created a VPC from scratch with subnets, route tables and IGW. Then we associated the public subnets to the route table with a route to the internet.



## Today's plan
- Finish VPC Slides
- Add 2 more EC2 instances in remaining subnets.
- Demo/Lab on how a bastion host works
